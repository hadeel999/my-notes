**I'm Hadeel Saleh, a 22 years old. I graduated from Jordan University as a computer engineer with GPA 3.60. I like prgramming and I hope in future I will be a professtional programmer.**

*By reading [Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in 15 minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/) article I have learnt the paragraph below:*

Being a good deveoper is not that hard thing to do, you just have to change your thinking way. During programming you must keep in your that your code does not have to be so long and complicated, instead it should be simple, easy to learn, readable and can be reused and maininated in future. To do that, you must understand clearly the problem that you want to solve by your code and design our solution based on what is the situation right now without predict other problems in future and try solving them. Also your design must be helpful for users, simple and easy for you.  

***Thank you.***
